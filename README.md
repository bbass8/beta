## Design

## Service microservice

The models that I created represent all the valuable data necessary for eventually making a sale on CarCar. This includes a salesperson, a customer, an automobile and a sale. The automobile value object is the class I created that is used in my poller file to communicate with the inventory microservice, which grabs the automobile data and gives my sales microservice access to it. This is done using the vin of the automobile.
